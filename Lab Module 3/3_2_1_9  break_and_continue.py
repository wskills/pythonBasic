﻿# Scenario
# The break statement is used to exit/terminate a loop.

# Design a program that uses a while loop and continuously asks the user to enter a word unless the user enters "chupacabra" 
# as the secret exit word, in which case the message "You've successfully left the loop." should be printed to the screen, 
# and the loop should terminate.

# Don't print any of the words entered by the user. Use the concept of conditional execution and the break statement.

user_input = input()

while user_input != "chupacabra":
    user_input = input()
    if user_input == "chupacabra":
        break
print("You've successfully left the loop")
