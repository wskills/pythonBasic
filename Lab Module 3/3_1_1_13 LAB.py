# EXAMPLE 1 - conditional statements
# x = 10

# if x == 10: # condition
#     print("x is equal to 10")  # Executed if the condition is True.

# EXAMPLE 2 - if series
# x = 10

# if x > 5: # condition one
#     print("x is greater than 5")  # Executed if condition one is True.

# if x < 10: # condition two
#     print("x is less than 10")  # Executed if condition two is True.

# if x == 10: # condition three
#     print("x is equal to 10")  # Executed if condition three is True.

# EXAMPLE 3 - if else
# x = 10

# if x < 10:  # Condition
#     print("x is less than 10")  # Executed if the condition is True.

# else:
#     print("x is greater than or equal to 10")  # Executed if the condition is False.

# EXAMPLE 4 - series of ifs 
# x = 11

# if x > 5:  # True
#     print("x > 5")

# if x > 8:  # True
#     print("x > 8")
